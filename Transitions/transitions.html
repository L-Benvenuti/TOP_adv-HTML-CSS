            <p>This is a stacking context example</p>
            <!-- stacking, from my understanding, occurs when there are
            two transitions to happen and the one 'above' starts first so
            then the other can go -- in this case, the rotating starts
            first, and then the button starts its own transition -->
            <!-- just an extra comment here that the word START is very
            important, as the 'above' will technically start first but it
            will depend on the timing delay set up to actually see the
            transition, if I have a longer timing delay for the 'above'
            transition, it will take longer for me to see it than the 'below'
            transition that has a shorter timing delay -->
